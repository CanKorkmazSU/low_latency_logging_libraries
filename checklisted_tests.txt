COMMON
1. Write a common template for testing cases
2. test under
    :Quill, Unbounded With 4MB Max Queue Size, Starting at 32'768Kb, Dropping
    .100'000 iterations, time callsite latency, realistic scenario, O1 optimizations
    .1'000'000 iterations, time callsite latency

    :Spdlog, Bounded With 4MB Queue Size, Dropping
    .100'000 iterations, time callsite latency, realistic scenario, O1 optimizations
    .1'000'000 iterations, time callsite latency

    :Quill, Unbounded With 4MB Max Queue Size, Starting at 32'768Kb, Blocking
    -Same As Above
3. display common use cases
    .Logging at different log levels
    .Multiplexing logs to multiple files
    .Filtering and adding callbacks to log calls
